    <h3>Tales from the Towpath</h3>
    <p class="author">Gene Earl Thompson</p>

        <p class="blurb">
          In this collection drawn from his journals and short stories, Thompson
          reflects on life, love, loss, mothers, and finding more than a bit of
          humor in daily life. Assembled posthumously by his grandchildren, the
          book is the result of many difficult choices guided by a long
          engagement with the author and his writing.

      <h2>Submissions</h2>
      <p>
        Towpath Publishing's mentorship program is currently open to a small number of submissions.
        We are interested in American stories, including memoir, short fiction,
        essays, and regional writing. This program is intended for authors pursuing self-publishing who are looking for guidance, feedback, and perspective—not traditional publication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please include a brief pitch, a short bio, and either the first ten pages
        or up to three short pieces.
